	<h4>Hailu Gudura<br>Director of Sidama National Region State Revenue Authority </h4>
	<p>First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for your unwavering dedication and relentless efforts in fulfilling our mandate. Together, we have achieved significant milestones, overcoming challenges and adapting to evolving landscapes. Our commitment to excellence and integrity has been the cornerstone of our success.<br>

In today's dynamic and ever-changing global economy, the role of revenue authorities has become increasingly vital. We are tasked with ensuring the efficient collection of revenues, which serves as the lifeblood of our nation's development initiatives. I would like to emphasize the significance of own-source revenues in our region’s journey towards self-reliance and progress. By generating revenue from within our own resources, we are able to reduce our dependence on external sources and gain greater control over our economic destiny. These own source revenues enable us to allocate funds to vital sectors such as healthcare and education, empowering us to provide better facilities and opportunities for our citizens. It is our responsibility to strike a delicate balance between facilitating economic growth and safeguarding the interests of our citizens in the region.<br>

To achieve our objectives, we must continue to embrace innovation and leverage technological advancements. The digital revolution has presented us with unprecedented opportunities to streamline processes, enhance taxpayer services, and combat tax evasion and fraud. By harnessing the power of data analytics, and automation, we can optimize our operations, reduce compliance costs, and improve overall efficiency.<br>

Furthermore, fostering a culture of transparency and trust is paramount. We must engage in open communication and collaboration with taxpayers, businesses, and other stakeholders. By providing clear and accessible guidance, we empower individuals and organizations to meet their tax obligations responsibly. By nurturing a supportive environment, we can encourage voluntary compliance and reduce the tax gap.<br>

In our pursuit of excellence, we must also prioritize capacity building and knowledge transfer. Investing in the professional development of our workforce is essential to stay ahead of emerging trends and evolving tax landscapes. By equipping our staff with the necessary skills and expertise, we ensure that our revenue authority remains agile, adaptable, and capable of meeting the challenges of tomorrow.<br>

Lastly, let us not forget the social impact of our work. The revenues we collect are not mere numbers on a balance sheet; it represents the resources that fuel critical public services, infrastructure development, and social welfare programs. By optimizing revenue collection, we should feel that we contribute to the well-being and prosperity of our nation, fostering inclusive growth and improving the lives of our fellow citizens in the region.<br>

In conclusion, I extend my deepest appreciation to each and every one of you for your unwavering commitment and dedication. Our collective efforts will shape the future of our revenue authority and, in turn, the economic trajectory of our nation. Together, we can build a stronger and more prosperous future for all.
